# cargo-anvil Implementation Guide

This guide describes internal implementation constraints that keep the emitted behavior aligned
with the user-visible contract in [design](./design/README.md).

## Pull request title validation

The `pr-title.just` template owns both title validation and its failure diagnostic. The ordered
human-readable pattern list is the source of truth: the PowerShell recipe expands its placeholders
into regular-expression fragments and uses the same list verbatim in the error message. Allowed
types are likewise defined once and used for both case-insensitive matching and diagnostics.

Changes to accepted title syntax must therefore modify the pattern or type data rather than adding
a separate regular expression. Pattern expansion escapes the display syntax before injecting the
trusted regular-expression fragments; the reverse order would escape the fragments themselves and
match them literally.

The skip path is shared by an unset and an explicitly empty `PR_TITLE`, because cloud backends
publish an empty value outside a pull request context. Snapshot tests pin the emitted template,
while the focused integration test executes the generated recipe and verifies accepted titles,
rejected titles, both skip cases, and corrective output.

## Workspace formatting

Formatting uses the catalog-pinned cargo-each release to fan out one rustfmt
child per workspace member. The canonical recipe owns the `{manifest}`
substitution and aggregate failure propagation; generated prerequisite recipes
own installation and version validation. Generated copies and snapshots keep
those pieces synchronized.

The modified impact category is only a run-or-skip gate. It never supplies
package arguments to the formatter, so cargo-each's workspace-member selection
remains the formatter's input boundary.

## Semantic-version candidate selection

The SemVer recipe builds candidates from Cargo metadata before intersecting them
with the affected package set. Cargo serializes unrestricted publication as
`null`, forbidden publication as an empty array, and named-registry restrictions
as a nonempty array. Only the empty-array form is excluded; library targets in
the other two forms remain candidates.

The canonical recipe owns this mapping, baseline availability checks, and
per-package execution. Focused contract tests cover every publication form,
while generated copies and snapshots detect drift from the template.

## Stable toolchain selection and setup

The stable selector has two canonical implementation sites because it must run
before Cargo can parse the root manifest. `versions.just` owns the lazy
per-command argument expression; `tools.just` owns provisioning, workspace-MSRV
validation, and the dedicated MSRV-test selection. Their small line-oriented
root-manifest scanners intentionally duplicate the same accepted syntax and
`workspace.package`-before-`package` precedence. Changes to one scanner must
update the other and their focused resolver tests in the same patch.

Both implementations enforce the same ordinary-check decision table:

1. a nonempty caller `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` emits no explicit argument;
2. the presence of either root toolchain-file spelling emits no explicit
   argument;
3. otherwise the root MSRV emits `+<MSRV>`;
4. absence of every source fails.

The empty argument in the first two cases is load-bearing. It preserves
rustup's native environment and working-directory-sensitive toolchain-file
behavior, including profiles, components, targets, and path channels, without
Anvil parsing or replaying suppressed options.

`_anvil-resolve-stable` owns the setup actions. The optional
`ANVIL_MSRV_TOOLCHAIN` maps only the dedicated MSRV run and is rejected as an
unpaired stable configuration when no ordinary stable selector exists.
Workspace-MSRV validation is read-only: it confirms rustup is present and the
exact root-MSRV toolchain is installed before invoking metadata, so Cargo
cannot auto-install a compiler during validation. Installation uses the same
anchored toolchain-list match and emits a dedicated rustup bootstrap diagnostic
when the executable is absent.

`tools.just` additionally exposes the declared root MSRV as the `root-msrv`
action, answering with the version or `none`. It exists for the container image
tag, which hashes that value, and being total matters there: an empty answer and
an unasked question must not hash alike. It reads the manifest through the same
scanner as every other path.

Setup dependencies, rather than the cloud templates, route provisioning.
Cargo-tool installers, default-component installers, and stable-only setup
leaves depend on `anvil-toolchain-stable-install`; group and tier fan-out lets
Just deduplicate that prerequisite. GitHub and ADO setup restore Cargo home,
bootstrap Just, and invoke the selected catalog setup recipe. Neither backend
adds a duplicate standalone stable-provisioning step.

Cloud Cargo-home keys include `.cargo/config.toml`, both repository
toolchain-file spellings, and `versions.just`. They deliberately exclude
`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and the resolved compiler version because cached
Cargo-installed tools do not depend on routine workspace dependency changes,
while toolchain files and catalog pins define the cache-pruning boundary.
Rustup toolchains live outside Cargo home.

Canonical recipes and workflow fragments live under `templates/`. The artifact
registry embeds those files, renderer tests pin conditional substitutions such
as ADO's `pr-fast`-only title lookup, and snapshot tests pin complete emitted
backends. After a canonical change, run cargo-anvil against this repository to
refresh owned mirrors and `.anvil.lock`; regenerate crate README content from
`src/lib.rs`, never by editing `README.md`.

## Miri compile-once runner

The public Miri contract is behavioral: compile the selected package scope
together once, run the resulting Miri test executables concurrently, preserve
workspace feature unification, honor package exclusions and worker limits, and
report deterministic output with aggregate failure. The exact Cargo message
schema and the hidden cargo-miri runner phase are implementation details tied
to the catalog-pinned nightly.

### Ownership and recipe graph

The canonical recipe set comprises
`templates/justfiles/anvil/checks/miri.just`,
`templates/justfiles/anvil/checks/miri-tree-borrows.just`,
`templates/justfiles/anvil/checks/miri-strict-provenance.just`, and
`templates/justfiles/anvil/checks/miri-race-coverage.just`. `miri.just` owns the
shared implementation, while the three stricter profile templates contain only
their public recipe and setup leaves. Each public recipe uses a parameterized
`_anvil-miri-test` dependency, keeping the main execution path and failure
propagation in Just's dependency graph. The shared recipe owns impact
resolution, profile-specific environment setup, compilation, discovery,
execution, reporting, and cleanup.

`src/anvil/artifacts/justfile.rs` registers these templates and structurally
pins the public-to-private delegation. Full emitted-tree snapshots pin the
canonical/generated boundary. Any template change must regenerate the in-tree
copies and `.anvil.lock`.

### Scope, metadata, and compilation

The shared recipe queries `_anvil-impact-include affected` after its
`anvil-impact` prerequisite has refreshed the cache. It maps the standard,
Tree Borrows, strict-provenance, and race-coverage parameter values to their
recipe names and profile flags before invoking Cargo.

Cargo metadata and the compiler-artifact stream must come from the same pinned
nightly Cargo. Cargo changed package-ID formatting in 1.78, so joining metadata
from a stable or MSRV Cargo to nightly compiler artifacts would fail for older
adopters. Metadata supplies the workspace-member set, package labels, manifest
directories, and `[package.metadata.anvil.miri] exclude` policy. Full-workspace
selection translates exclusions to Cargo `--exclude` arguments; impact-scoped
selection removes excluded version-qualified package selectors before
compilation. Excluded packages remain available as dependencies.

The compile phase uses `cargo miri test --all-features --tests --no-run` with
Cargo's JSON diagnostic stream. Executable `compiler-artifact` records whose
test profile is active are admitted as Miri test executables; exact executable
paths are de-duplicated defensively. Each admitted artifact must map back to
workspace metadata so execution can restore its package working directory and
produce a stable package/target label. Build scripts and ordinary executables
are not admitted. A successful compile with no admitted artifacts is a
successful no-op.

### Pinned cargo-miri runner protocol

The compile and execute phases form one protocol owned by the pinned Miri
toolchain. Cargo-miri serializes the build-time invocation state used by its
hidden runner phase. Before dispatching an artifact, the recipe prepares the
Miri sysroot, resolves the pinned toolchain sysroot, locates cargo-miri under
that toolchain, and establishes the ambient rustc-mode sentinel expected by
the serialized run information. The runner then restores the recorded state
and starts Miri interpretation from the artifact's package directory. Runtime
arguments are not part of that serialized state when `--no-run` suppresses
Cargo's runner invocation, so a requested libtest filter is passed explicitly
to every hidden runner invocation.

These steps are not a public cargo-anvil API and may change when the pinned
nightly changes. A nightly update must therefore revalidate sysroot discovery,
cargo-miri lookup, the ambient sentinel, serialized environment restoration,
working-directory restoration, and hidden runner invocation through the
executable contract tests.

### Parallel execution and reporting

Artifacts are sorted by package label, target kind, target name, and path
before assigning stable indices. PowerShell dispatches them with
`ForEach-Object -Parallel`, throttled by `ANVIL_MIRI_JOBS` or the host logical
processor count and always clamped to the artifact count. Each worker restores
the owning package directory, invokes cargo-miri for one executable, and writes
combined output to an isolated log.

After every worker completes, the parent replays logs by stable artifact index,
using backend-native output groups when available. It reports all failed
labels together and returns failure only after every executable has completed.
A unique temporary directory owns the artifact manifest and worker logs and is
removed from a `finally` block on every exit path.

### Verification boundaries

Three layers guard different parts of the subsystem:

- structural tests in `src/anvil/artifacts/justfile.rs` pin parameterized
  delegation, bounded parallelism, deterministic ordering, and grouped output;
- executable contracts in `tests/recipe_contracts.rs` fake Cargo, rustc, and
  cargo-miri to verify metadata/artifact identity, exclusions, environment and
  working-directory restoration, profile flags, concurrency, no-work behavior,
  deterministic replay, and aggregate failure;
- backend snapshots pin every emitted recipe copy, while the regeneration
  check verifies the repository copies and `.anvil.lock`.

## Impact scoping and tier routing

Impact scoping lets a clean PR run each check against only the cargo packages its committed
diff touches, while unscoped checks, scheduled/full runs, and a dirty working tree still cover
the whole workspace. The *user-visible* contract for this — commands, `ANVIL_IMPACT` values,
per-check policy, and CI shape — lives in the design chapters ([local](./design/local.md) §4,
[checks](./design/checks.md) §5, [github](./design/github.md), [ado](./design/ado.md),
[containers](./design/containers.md)). This section records only the internal architecture and
the synchronization boundaries that keep those promises true across the three backends.

### Source-of-truth boundaries

The subsystem is deliberately split so each fact has exactly one owner:

- **The recipe is the algorithm.** `templates/justfiles/anvil/impact.just` owns *all* impact
  logic — base-ref resolution, the two snapshots, cache-key composition, the throwaway
  worktree, dirty-tree widening, tier projection, and the cargo-delta-identifier → Cargo
  package-selector mapping. The emitted `justfiles/anvil/impact.just` is a generated copy; it
  is never hand-edited, and the snapshot tests (`tests/snapshots/`) pin the emitted text so a
  template change that isn't regenerated fails CI.
- **The catalog registers the file.** `src/anvil/artifacts/justfile.rs::impact()` registers
  the recipe as an owned artifact; `src/anvil/artifacts/mod.rs` wires it into the built-in
  registry and holds the shared tier→mode policy (`impact_mode`). The ADO renderer (`ado.rs`)
  substitutes that policy's value into the `__IMPACT_MODE__` token of each per-group job.
  GitHub does not template the mode per group: its reusable-workflow YAML fixes it statically
  (`pr-impl-workflow.yml` passes `impact_mode: consume`; the scheduled workflow omits it, so
  `run-group-action`'s default `off` applies). Both paths encode the same tier rule — PR
  groups consume, scheduled groups run full — so a group's mode can never diverge between
  backends.
- **Design docs are the contract.** They describe observable behavior; they are not consulted
  by the code and must not be cited from it (see the root `AGENTS.md`).

The `every_check_matches_its_declared_impact_policy` test in `justfile.rs` is the guard that
keeps the per-check policy table, the emitted recipes, and the documented mapping in agreement:
each check's structural `_anvil-impact-include <category>` call (or its absence) is pinned to an
expected category, so a check silently gaining, losing, or changing scoping fails there.

### Cache identity and invalidation

The recipe keeps two independently keyed snapshots under `target/anvil/impact/snapshots/`:

- `baseline.json` (base ref) — expensive (needs a throwaway git worktree). Keyed on the
  **composite** of the base commit sha *and* the effective `.delta.toml` identity, persisted in
  `baseline.key` as `<base-sha> <config-hash>`. Folding the config hash in is a correctness
  requirement, not an optimization: the config governs *what* every snapshot captures, so a
  warm cache keyed on the base sha alone could diff a stale-config baseline against a
  new-config current snapshot and silently mis-scope.
- `current.json` (working tree) — cheap. Keyed on the HEAD sha alone (`current.key`); the
  dirty-tree guard means a snapshotted tree corresponds exactly to HEAD.

The composite baseline key is why the base worktree is retaken when the base moves *or*
`.delta.toml` changes; `baseline_regenerates_when_delta_config_changes_without_moving_the_base`
pins that second input. The worktree lives under the runner-managed scratch dir
(`RUNNER_TEMP` → `AGENT_TEMPDIRECTORY` → system temp) and is named with `$PID` so concurrent
runs never collide or remove each other's checkout; it is always removed in a `finally`.

### Fail-closed mapping and the dirty-tree safety net

cargo-delta reports library/target identifiers that do not uniquely name a Cargo package, so
`_anvil-impact-format` reverse-maps them to version-qualified package selectors using three
Ordinal (case-sensitive) lookups (package name, lib/proc-macro target, manifest-dir leaf). When
a reported identifier resolves to **zero** packages (an unmapped gap) or **more than one** (an
ambiguity), the recipe fails hard rather than guessing — under-scoping would silently skip
affected work. Complementarily, a dirty working tree (any uncommitted change outside `target/`,
detected via a git `:(exclude)` pathspec) widens *every* tier to `--workspace` locally, because
cargo-delta scopes on the committed diff and cannot see working-tree edits. Cloud checkouts are clean, so this
only affects local runs.

### Mode routing before dependency evaluation

`ANVIL_IMPACT` has three modes — producer (unset/compute), `consume` (read a downloaded cache),
and `off` (full workspace). The critical invariant is that the mode must be established in the
shell **before** `just` evaluates a recipe's dependencies, because scoped checks take a
`: anvil-impact` dependency. `helpers.just`'s `_anvil-unscoped` therefore exports
`ANVIL_IMPACT=off` before re-invoking the private tier or group, so those recipes are
never scoped. `container.just` sets the same variable through the engine's `-e` when a
containerized run needs it. `justfile.rs` asserts the off-before-dependencies ordering.

### Cross-backend CI handoff

Both backends compute the impact set once per OS family and transport it to the consuming jobs
as a per-OS artifact, rather than threading it through stage/output variables:

- **GitHub** (`pr-impl-workflow.yml`): `impact-linux` / `impact-windows` jobs run the
  `anvil-impact` composite action and upload `anvil-impact-<os>`; group jobs download it and run
  under `ANVIL_IMPACT=consume`. The impact jobs check out without `lfs: true` (they read only
  path/metadata inputs), and the setup action excludes `target/` from its cache so the
  downloaded impact cache is neither dwarfed nor clobbered.
- **ADO** (`steps/impact.yml`, `steps/job.yml`): the impact step publishes the cache as a
  pipeline artifact; `job.yml`'s `inputArtifacts` parameter defaults to `DownloadPipelineArtifact@2`
  but is overridable so 1ESPT-compliant pipelines can substitute their own download mechanism.
  The impact step does not set `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` because it compiles no workspace code.

The producer/consumer split means the same recipe code runs locally (produce + consume in one
process) and in CI (produce in one job, consume in many), which is what lets the behavioral
tests in `tests/impact.rs` exercise the real recipe rather than a CI-only path.

## GitHub group execution and status reporting

The generated `anvil-run-group` composite action owns the
capture-before-propagation protocol. Its inline Bash step invokes Just through
`tee`, temporarily disables immediate exit, and reads `PIPESTATUS[0]` so the
saved result belongs to Just rather than `tee`. It selects the final standard
Just failed-recipe diagnostic, including the optional line-number form, and
falls back to the group recipe when a tool exits without that diagnostic. The
step writes the recipe and exit code as outputs, then returns the captured
status itself. This is a correctness constraint for diagnostics: the GitHub
step marked failed must be the step containing the complete recipe output.
Moving propagation to a later synthetic step would make GitHub focus on that
empty step and hide the useful output behind a successful predecessor.

The reporter uses `always()`, so GitHub runs it after the group step fails and
the outputs written before propagation remain available to it. Its
`continue-on-error` remains necessary because supplemental API reporting must
not replace or obscure the authoritative recipe result.

The status reporter is an inline `actions/github-script` body. It validates the
pull-request head SHA, reads same-commit status history newest-first, and keeps
only the newest value for each context. An encoded group marker in the workflow
run URL identifies statuses owned by the current group. The visible context
also contains the group so identical recipe failures reached from different
groups remain independent. A new failure is published before old contexts are
superseded, preventing a temporary failure-free rollup. Clean runs only
supersede active failures; they do not add a fresh supplemental status.

The reporter's API errors are ignored by the composite action because the
native workflow job is authoritative. The generated root workflow grants the
required status permission only to the same-repository pull-request caller.
Merge-group and fork execution retain annotations and the named failure step
without a write-capable status token.

Tests extract and execute the exact YAML-embedded Bash and JavaScript bodies.
The Bash harness covers success, both Just diagnostic forms, and a failure
without a diagnostic. The JavaScript harness mocks status-history pagination
and publication to cover setup and recipe failures, cleanup, ownership,
deduplication, ordering, truncation, and missing event data. Snapshot tests pin
the complete emitted artifacts.
