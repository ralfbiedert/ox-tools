//! Generic plan drivers.

//! Two reusable engine drivers turn a catalog artifact into a
//! [`crate::plan::PlanItem`] for a single repository: [`plan_owned_file`] for
//! a fully tool-owned file and [`plan_managed_region`] for a
//! sentinel-delimited region spliced into a host file. They are
//! catalog-agnostic — the engine's plan builder feeds them the bodies the
//! catalog supplies. The anvil base catalog's templates live in
//! [`crate::anvil`].
