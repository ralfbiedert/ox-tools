//! Containerized execution: the `anvil-container` recipe and the image it runs.
//!
//! The recipe drives the engine and computes the image identity; the Dockerfile
//! defines what the image contains; its build-context ignore file decides what
//! reaches the build at all, and the two must be replaced together. There is no
//! configuration file: whether the group is emitted at all is a catalog
//! decision, and the only host-specific value — which engine to call — is an
//! environment variable read by the recipe at run time.
//!
//! # Why the Dockerfile is composed, not owned
//!
//! The Dockerfile is a **user-composed file with managed regions**, not a
//! wholly-owned file. An owned file that invites in-place edits fails silently
//! here: anvil preserves the edit and writes its own version to
//! `.anvil-proposed`, with no three-way merge and no recorded ancestor, so a
//! repository that edits it once keeps building on the base digest and the four
//! tool pins frozen at that moment — while `anvil-container-tag` keeps
//! resolving, because the tag hashes *their* file. The identity scheme works
//! perfectly and still names a stale image.
//!
//! Splitting anvil's content into regions does not make it read-only: the same
//! ownership rules apply to a region body as to a file, and anvil never
//! overwrites repository content. What it removes is the *reason* to edit: each
//! gap between the regions is the correct home for one class of addition,
//! defined by what must already be true at that point in the build.
//!
//! | Gap | Runs | Exists for |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | after [`dockerfile_base_image`] | before `FROM` | re-declaring `ARG BASE_IMAGE` to build on your own base |
//! | after [`dockerfile_base`] | before the first download | root CA, proxy, internal apt mirror |
//! | after [`dockerfile_tools`] | after the toolchain, before `anvil-setup` | libraries a catalog tool needs to *compile* |
//! | after [`dockerfile_setup`] | after the catalog is installed | what the repository's own checks need at run time |
//!
//! The base image is the case that most needed a gap of its own: it is the
//! setting a repository is likeliest to want, and leaving it inside a region
//! would have made overriding it mean editing anvil's content — freezing every
//! pin in the file to buy one substitution.
//!
//! A downstream catalog customizes by replacing individual regions, and
//! inherits the rest:
//!
//! - [`dockerfile_base_image`] / [`dockerfile_tools`] plus
//!   [`Artifact::with_body`] to build on a different base OS or install the
//!   toolchain from a different source. [`dockerfile_setup`] and
//!   [`dockerfile_entry`] are the contract with the recipe and are rarely
//!   replaced.
//! - [`dockerignore`] alongside them when the replacement copies more of the
//!   tree, or the added paths never reach the build context.
//! - [`hooks`] to supply credentials, or to resolve a published image through
//!   `Anvil-ResolveImage`. The recipe loads the file when it is present,
//!   regardless of who put it there.

/// tool set and then be tagged with the same content hash a credentialed build
/// produces, so every later run would reuse the broken image.

/// change must not block the developer who made it.
