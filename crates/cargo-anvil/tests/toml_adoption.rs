//! Snapshot tests for onboarding a TOML host that already declares the
//! region's table by hand.
//!
//! Each test stages one hand-written host, runs `cargo anvil` over it, and
//! snapshots a single report: the host as the user wrote it, the decision
//! anvil reached for every region of that host, any refusal it raised, and the
//! host as anvil left it. The assertions elsewhere pin individual properties —
//! that a file parses, that a key survives, that a refusal names a table. These
//! snapshots pin the thing a reader actually has to judge: what the user's file
//! looks like afterwards.
//!
//! The scenarios are the ones this behaviour was built and reviewed against:
//! adopting a hand-written table (issue #148), refusing a key both sides
//! declare, refusing residue that cannot stay in the table it came from,
//! keeping an unmanaged dotted assignment, and leaving a CRLF host's line
//! endings alone.
//!
//! Reviewed with `cargo insta review`; snapshots live under `tests/snapshots/`.
