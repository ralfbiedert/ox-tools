## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-04

- ♻️ Code Refactoring

  - move container assets out of justfiles ([#63](https://github.com/microsoft/ox-tools/pull/63))

- 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 📝 Documentation

  - rename the design doc to `README.md` and update the in-code links that

  - add the crate logo ([#61](https://github.com/microsoft/ox-tools/pull/61))

- 🔧 Dependencies

  - bump the `toml_edit` requirement from 0.22.22 to 0.25.12 ([#44](https://github.com/microsoft/ox-tools/pull/44))
  - bump `syn` from 2.0.117 to 2.0.119 ([#57](https://github.com/microsoft/ox-tools/pull/57)) —
    lockfile only; `syn` reaches `cargo-anvil` transitively through the
    `clap_derive` and `ohno_macros` proc macros

- 📝 Notes

  - Tier recipes now route through `_anvil-run`, and a new `anvil-runner`
    managed region is emitted into the root `Justfile`. Repositories that do
    not opt into the container backend keep running natively by default, but
    regenerating does change the emitted tree.
  - Non-recipe container assets live under `.anvil/container/`; the entry
    recipe stays in `justfiles/` as a single `anvil/container.just` file.
